# daw

## Current State
- Not at all complete. Currently comprised of audio experiments.

## Why
- I want to learn low level apliaction development and thought a daw would be a good project to align my tinkering.
- I also want to learn more about music and sound design. This seems like a good way to kill two birds with one stone.

## Core Principles
- **Abstraction to organize not to hide**
  - I want to use this project to organize my thoughts on music and application development and I want that to be visible throught the software.

## Insperations
- Blender
  - In my opinion blender has the best user interface
  - I realy like blenders node system and realy want **synth nodes**
  - Fast startup is importaint to me as someone who likes to tinker and fiddle with software on a whim
- Git
  - Project recovery
  - Reverting decisions
  - Colaberation
